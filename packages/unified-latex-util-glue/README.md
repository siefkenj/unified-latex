# unified-latex-util-glue

## What is this?

Functions to parse TeX glue (e.g. `1in plus 3cm minus .2pt`).

## When should I use this?

If you need access to the values of glue to analyze `\setlength` commands or write
linters.

## Install

```bash
npm install @unified-latex/unified-latex-util-glue
```

This package contains both esm and commonjs exports. To explicitly access the esm export,
import the `.js` file. To explicitly access the commonjs export, import the `.cjs` file.

# Functions

## `extractFormattedGlue(nodes, startIndex)`

Extract glue from a list of nodes returning a node array with
properly formatted glue as well as start/end indices where the glue was
"sliced out" of `nodes`.

Sometimes glue may end in the middle of a string node. If this happens, the
string node is split and the second half is returned in the `trailingStrings` array.

```typescript
function extractFormattedGlue(
  nodes: (Ast.Node | Ast.Argument)[],
  startIndex: Number
): {
  glue: Ast.Node[];
  span: { start: number; end: number };
  trailingStrings: Ast.String[];
};
```

**Parameters**

| Param      | Type                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------- |
| nodes      | `(Ast.Node \| Ast.Argument)[]` |
| startIndex | `Number`                       |

## `findGlue(nodes, startIndex)`

Finds patterns matching TeX glue in `nodes`. A pretty-formatted version
of the glue is returned along with information about how many nodes were consumed.

The return object consists of

*   `printedGlue` - the pretty-printed version of the glue
*   `endIndex` - the index in `nodes` where the glue string terminates
*   `partialSliceLen` - how far into the `Ast.String` node the glue string finished. For example `1ptXX` would parse as `1pt`, and the parsing would terminate partway through the string node.

```typescript
function findGlue(
  nodes: (Ast.Node | Ast.Argument)[],
  startIndex: Number
): { printedGlue: Ast.Node[]; endIndex: number; partialSliceLen: number };
```

**Parameters**

| Param      | Type                           |
| :--------- | :----------------------------- |
| nodes      | `(Ast.Node \| Ast.Argument)[]` |
| startIndex | `Number`                       |

## `parseTexGlue(source)`

Parse a string that starts with TeX glue (e.g. `1pt` or `1pt plus 2em`).
It is assumed that all whitespace and comments have been stripped from the glue

```typescript
function parseTexGlue(source: String): Glue;
```

**Parameters**

| Param  | Type     |
| :----- | :------- |
| source | `String` |

## `printGlue(glue)`

Prints a `Glue` object to an AST. After printing, `glue`
is turned into a sequence of string and whitespace nodes.
All structural information about the glue is lost.

```typescript
function printGlue(glue: Glue): Ast.Node[];
```

**Parameters**

| Param | Type   |
| :---- | :----- |
| glue  | `Glue` |

where

```typescript
type Glue = {
  type: "glue";
  fixed: Dim;
  stretchable: Dim | null;
  shrinkable: Dim | null;
  position: { start: Position; end: Position };
};
```

# Types

## `Glue`

```typescript
export type Glue = {
    type: "glue";
    fixed: Dim;
    stretchable: Dim | null;
    shrinkable: Dim | null;
    position: { start: Position; end: Position };
};
```
