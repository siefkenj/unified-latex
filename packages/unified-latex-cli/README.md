# unified-latex-cli

## What is this?

Command line interface to common `unified-latex` functions.

## When should I use this?

If you want to reformat, process, or gather statistic on LaTeX files from the command line.

## Examples

Reformat and pretty-print a file

```bash
unified-latex input.tex -o output.tex
```

List all commands defined via `\newcommand` and friends (and hide the file output).

```bash
unified-latex input.tex --no-stdout --stats
```

Expand the definition of the macro `\foo{...}`, which takes one argument.

```bash
unified-latex input.tex -e "\\newcommand{foo}[1]{FOO(#1)}"
```

View the parsed AST.

```bash
unified-latex input.tex --inspect
```

Convert the file to HTML. (Note, you will need to include and configure a library like *MathJax* or *KaTeX* to render
any math in the resulting HTML. Warnings are provided for macros that aren't recognized by the converter.)

```bash
unified-latex input.tex -o output.html --html
```

Lint all tex files in the current directory and watch for changes.

```bash
unified-latex . --no-stdout --lint-all --watch
```

## Install

```bash
npm install @unified-latex/unified-latex-cli
```
